# Python_for_DS_and_ML_udemy

Repository with Jupyter Notebooks respecting to some (the most relevant) projects/exercises from Udemy's couse on Python for data science and machine learning.
This course included modules on pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and tensorflow.

## Brief list of contents:

#### 01-911 Calls Data Capstone Project.ipynb

Notebook with data exploration and visualization  on a dataset of 911 calls.

#### 01-SF Salaries Exercise.ipynb	

Notebook with data exploration and visualization on a dataset of salary data.

#### 02-Pandas Data Visualization Exercise.ipynb	

Notebook with some exercises on data visualization using pandas built-in visualization.

#### 02-Matplotlib Exercises.ipynb	

Notebook with some exercises on data visualization using matplotlib.

#### 03-Ecommerce Purchases Exercise .ipynb	

Notebook with data analysis on online shopping data.

#### 02-K Means Clustering Project.ipynb	

Notebook with data analysis using K-means clustering on classifying university data.

#### 02-K Nearest Neighbors Project.ipynb	

Notebook with data analysis using K nearest neighbours on artifitial data.

#### 02-Linear Regression Project.ipynb	

Notebook with data analysis using linear regression on ecommerce/advertising data.

#### 02-Logistic Regression Project.ipynb	

Notebook with data analysis using logistic regression on advertising data.

#### 02-Decision Trees and Random Forest Project.ipynb	

Notebook with data analysis using decision trees and random forests on lending data.

#### 02-NLP Project.ipynb

Notebook with data analysis using natural language processing on a set of text messages.

#### 02-Support Vector Machines Project.ipynb	

Notebook with data analysis using SVMs on the iris flower dataset.

#### Part1_Keras_project.ipynb + Part2_Keras_project.ipynb
Notebooks regarding the final project on the neural networks chapter. The data set used is a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle.

I had to create two notebooks, because the first one was getting a bit too heavy, leading to slow performance and kernel interrupting. Additionally, things got messy and I decided to start from scratch.
The first notebook Part1_Keras_project.ipynb contains the part of data exploration and visualization, while the remaining steps of feature cleaning/engineering and model deployment are in the second notebook: Part2_Keras_project.
